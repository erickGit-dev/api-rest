## Practice API-REST eCommerse-app
 This is a personal practice creating a Full-Stack web-app using the followings technologies:
- Node.js (Express.js)
- React.js
- Typescript 
- MongoDB (Mongoose)

### The server side
To start the server you need to install all the dependencies run `npm i` .
Run `npm run dev` to execute the app in develop mode.
Run  `npm run build` to transpile the code of Typescript to Javascript.
finaly run `npm start` to start the server.

### Endpoints 
The user manage and auth using JWT
- get/api/users
- post/api/singUp
- post/api/singIn/
- put/updateUser/:id'/
- delete/api/deleteUser/:id
